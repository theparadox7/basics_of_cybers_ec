MAC Address:
Mac address is nothing but Media access control address
Which will be 
•	Physical
•	Permanent
•	Unique
In a communication, the packets will flow from the source MAC to the destination MAC

Now we are going to change the  Mac address of a particular network:
Let’s say you are connected to a  wireless adopter and if u run --ifconfig
U can find it as wlan0.

Now run the following commands to change the mac address:
--ifconfig wlan0 down
-> Enter
(its disabled now)
•	--ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:55:44
(ether is nothing but a MAC address. If u find ether 00:11:1d:2f:3d… then 00:11:1d:2f:3d… I is your required MAC address)
•	--ifconfig wlan0 up

now if u run --ifconfig again you will note that the MAC address is changed to 00:11:22:33:55:44

NOTE: 
We are modifying the address in memory, not the physical address, therefore if you restart the computer, the Mac address will be reset to its original address
