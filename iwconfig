iwconfig:
The iwconfig command is a Linux command-line utility used to configure and display information about wireless network interfaces. It is typically used with wireless network adapters and is part of the Wireless Tools for Linux package
iwconfig [interface] [options]

iwconfig wlan0 
here wlan0 is your wireless interface.
Let us set mode to Monitor mode:
In this mode you will be able to trace packets nad all the wireless network available in yur adapter range. Follow the procedure below
•	iwconfig
# or
•	ifconfig
•	ifconfig [interface] down
# Replace [interface] with the name of your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0)
•	airmon-ng check kill
•	iwconfig wlan0 hw mode monitor
•	ifconfig [interface] up
# Replace [interface] with the name of your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0
This method always will not work for all adaptors. Below is the other procedure to change the mode to monitor mode.
•	iwconfig
# or
•	ifconfig
•	ifconfig [interface] down
•	airmon-ng check kill
•	airmon-ng start [interface]
•	# Replace [interface] with the name of your wireless interface (e.g., wlan0
You will find a message that mode is set to monitor mode.
Now you can check the mode of wlan0 by running
